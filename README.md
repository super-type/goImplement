# The GoImplement Encryption Library

The GoImplement encryption library is a low-touch API Client Library that simplifies the process of producing data to and consuming data from the Supertype data network. While all of this functionality is accessible through standard libraries or basic encryption libraries for most languages, GoImplement's goal is to further extend Supertype's goal of simplicity, and make the developer's life as easy as possible.

## Supertype's Encryption Scheme

Supertype uses a custom encryption mechanism built entirely on top of AES encryption, one of the most secure forms of encryption currently used. For more information about Supertype's encryption mechanism, [see here](https://github.com/super-type/supertype).
